Using Flog, we can see that many parts of our app are highly ineffective.
Refactoring the model is less effective than refactoring the controller 
  Move logic from controller actions to models, move business out to services!
  ::Services:: == module for performing stuff
    Now we're compatnig the model to a services module
    Service methods are tested independent of calling class
    # When a spec fails, it's telling you something.  Listen!
  Name your service for the action it performs
When organizing the logic in an object, use verb titles for your methods that tell a story
  When organinized step-wise bu forucinsg on the story of the module, this flog drops.
  No state maintained!
