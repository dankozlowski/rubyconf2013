Problem: We're executing in an environment we can't control.

Feature: Add mobile optimized search WITHOUT BREAKING ANYTHING D:
  Tools: Capybara, PhantomJS, Poltergeist
  `brew install phantomjs`
  add polgergist and capybara to gemfile.

js_errors true: failure tests if there's a JS error
inspector true: gives a live debugger

Simplest test for country search?
  Visit path, and fill in a field.  This will fail if any JS error occurs.
  in the describe block, set JS to true!

Gotchas:
  Waiting for stuff: Capybara will wait for things to change.  
    Syncrhonize: retry logic that evaluates over and over until it's condutions are true.
  PhantomJS crashes, sometimes not repeatable :/
    1% of time tests will fail because pJS crashed.
  Transactions in Capybara suck
    Capybara runs the test in another thread.  Capybara will rollback before it sees the data, or if you're using a cleaner the db may be cleared before Capybara has a chance to see the data.
      Run all tests that don't require JS.
